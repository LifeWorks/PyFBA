    "# Building a Network object from a Model object\n",

    "In this notebook, we will present the steps to generate a genome-scale metabolic model from *RAST* annotations, build a *PyFBA* Network object, and then demonstrate some of the metrics that can be calculated. Each network is represented as a directed graph. Compounds are the nodes and reactions are the directed edges. Bidirectional reactions are represnted as two edges.\n",
