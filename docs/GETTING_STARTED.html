<h1 id="getting-started-with-pyfba">Getting started with PyFBA</h1>
<p>The first thing you probably want to do is build a model for your genome. Because of the tight interplay between RAST, SEED, and Model SEED, the easiest way to get started is to run your genome through RAST.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-sbml-file">Using the SBML file</h2>
<p>If you have done that and built the model using the Model SEED, you can download the SBML file from RAST, and try either <a href="example_code/run_fba_sbml.py">run_fba_sbml.py</a> or <a href="example_code/sbml_to_fba.py">sbml_to_fba.py</a>. Both of these should give similar, but not identical answers to the answer that you got from the model SEED<sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-genome-annotation">Using the genome annotation</h2>
<p>If you have downloaded the annotation, there are two essential steps that you need to take to create a model:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Convert the genome annotation to reactions</li>
<li>Gapfill the reactions on different media.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="convert-the-genome-annotation-to-reactions">Convert the genome annotation to reactions</h3>
<p>You can use the <a href="example_code">example code</a> to get started. First, we will create a set of reactions from your genome. First, download the assigned_functions file from the genome directory, or get a list of all funcational roles in your genome. Next, convert those to a list of reactions, using one of two commands:</p>
<p>If you have an assigned_functions file that has [peg, functional role]:</p>
<pre><code>    python example_code/assigned_functions_to_reactions.py -a assigned_functions &gt; reactions.list</code></pre>
<p>or, if you just have a list of functional roles, one per line:</p>
<pre><code>    python example_code/assigned_functions_to_reactions.py -r functional_roles &gt; reactions.list</code></pre>
<h3 id="build-a-gapfilled-model">Build a gapfilled model</h3>
<p>We build a model from the reactions and then try and gap fill it using all of our approaches.</p>
<pre><code>python scripts/gapfill_from_reactions.py -r reactions.list -m MOPS_NoC_Alpha-D-Glucose.txt &gt; out.txt 2&gt; out.err</code></pre>
<p>This will use the media file <code>MOPS_NoC_Alpha-D-Glucose.txt</code> and try and gap fill the model so that it grows on this media.</p>
<hr />
<p><b id="f1">1</b> The reason that the answers are similar, but not identical, is because the linear solvers give slightly different answers. The Model SEED uses a commercial linear solver, but you are probably using GLPK. <a href="#a1">â†©</a></p>
