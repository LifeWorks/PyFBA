The aim of PyFBA is to provide an extensible, python-based platform for\r\nFBA work.\r\n\r\nPyFBA is being developed by Daniel Cuevas, Taylor O'Connell, and Rob Edwards in [Rob's bioinformatics\r\ngroup](http://edwards.sdsu.edu/research) at [San Diego State University](http://www.sdsu.edu/) together with help from\r\nJanaka Edirisinghe, Chris Henry, Ross Overbeek and others at [Argonne National Labs](http://www.theseed.org/).\r\n\r\n## Installing PyFBA\r\n\r\nTo use PyFBA you need Python 2.7 or greater, and you need to [install the GNU GLPK](INSTALLATION.md) and a Python\r\nwrapper for that program, pyGLPK available from [github](https://github.com/bradfordboyle/pyglpk). \r\n\r\nWe also leverage the [Model SEED GitHub](https://github.com/ModelSEED/ModelSEEDDatabase.git) repository with all the\r\nlatest biochemistry tables. \r\n\r\nOur [installation](INSTALLATION.md) page has detailed instructions on installing PyFBA and getting everything running.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started with PyFBA\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed GLPK, PyGLPK, and PyFBA, you will most likely want to build a model from a genome, gap fill that\r\nmodel, and test it for growth on different media. We have [detailed instructions](GETTING_STARTED.md) that walk you through the step-by-step\r\nprocedures that you need to use to run flux balance analysis on your own genome.\r\n\r\n### Copyright and License\r\n\r\nPyFBA is copyright Daniel Cuevas, Taylor O'Connell, and Rob Edwards, and is released under the MIT license.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
