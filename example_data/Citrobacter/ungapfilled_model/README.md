# Raw Data

The data in this directory is raw data from *Citrobacter sedlakii* that you can use to test some of the 
[gap-filling](../../../gapfill) approaches that we describe:

* [citrobacter.assigned_functions](citrobacter.assigned_functions) is a list of functional roles from RAST ID 67826.8
* [citrobacter.reactions](citrobacter.reactions] is a list of reactions the assigned functions using roles_to_reactions
* [citrobacter.roles](citrobacter.roles) is a list of roles in *all other Citrobacter* that can be used for gap-filling
* [closest.genomes](closest.genomes) is a list of closest genomes from RAST
* [closest.genomes.roles](closest.genomes.roles) is a list of all the roles in the closest genomes that can be used \
for gapfilling.
